## Challenges Faced

### 1. Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Initial navigation between screens was not smooth, with issues in passing data (props) correctly.
- **Solution**:
   - Reviewed the navigation logic.
   - Ensured structured and consistent data passing between screens.
   - This resulted in smoother transitions between the **User List** and **User Details** screens.

---

## App UI Overview

### 1. User List Screen
- Displays a list of users showing their name and email.
- Includes a search bar to dynamically filter the list by name.
- Tapping on a user navigates to the **User Details Screen**.

### 2. Filtering Functionality
- Type in the search bar to filter users by name.
- The list updates dynamically, showing only matching users, enhancing usability for large datasets.

### 3. User Details Screen
- Displays in-depth information about a selected user.
- Accessed by tapping on a user in the **User List Screen**.
